# Write a method called scrabble_score which should accept a string as a parameter and return the amount of points it is worth in Scrabble. You can use the following hash to determine how many points each letter is worth:
@points = {'a'=> 1, 'b'=> 3, 'c'=> 3, 'd'=> 2, 'e'=> 1, 'f'=> 4, 'g'=> 2, 'h'=> 4, 'i'=> 1, 'j'=> 8, 'k'=> 5, 'l'=> 1, 'm'=> 3, 'n'=> 1, 'o'=> 1, 'p'=> 3, 'q'=> 10, 'r'=> 1, 's'=> 1, 't'=> 1, 'u'=> 1, 'v'=> 4, 'w'=> 4, 'x'=> 8, 'y'=> 4, 'z'=> 10}
# Use the reduce method to perform the computation in your scrabble_score method. The code should work as follows:
def scrabble_score(string)
	split_string = string.split('')
	p points = split_string.map { |letter| score = @points[letter] }	
	p points.reduce { |sum, point| sum + point }
end



scrabble_score("scholar")  #=> 12
